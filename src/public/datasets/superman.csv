Just like Krypto the superdog, this movie is a bit unruly, but that's exactly what makes it so adorable. Operates as a vintage splash page of gods and monsters, with the usual James Gunn flavors - wacky creatures, naive heroes and relentlessly cruel villains, not to mention the dose of Parental Trauma - working in tandem with DC's new MO. I like that this is barely over two hours long, as its tone shifts rapidly from workplace screwball romance… more","7,726 likes"

Anthony Carrigan is the only performance with a fully realised compelling dramatic weight, and he’s a small character with maybe 10-15 minutes of screen time at most.

Superman evokes a few distinct feelings that few comic book movies have been able to capture as of late. An unmistakable sincerity shines through, with Corenswet radiating hope and buoyancy. The film feels like a vibrant throwback tonally, which doesn’t always work in its favor, yet its knack for striking emotional chords at the right moment is impressive.

James Gunn's Superman is fine, but if its director had the ability to moderate his approach and not resort to maximalism in every single aspect, it could have been great.
David Corenswet does an excellent job as the world's most famous superhero, with Rachel Brosnahan as his perfect Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult as a Lex Luthor who truly feels like a terrifying villain.

That’s my favourite take on the character. The film hits the ground running.

Unfortunately, Superman is Gunn’s worst theatrically released film - and, to be honest, maybe his worst major directorial effort at all - by a considerable margin.
Superman is a mess of a movie that seems like it’s been taken apart and stitched back together so often it’s lost in its own head. It feels like a film that began as something more interesting, and ended up being reconfigured several times over. There is a strange scent of panic… more",312 likes

That said, those final minutes with Iggy Pop’s ‘Punkrocker’ are masterful and emotional.

SupremeLemon (지존레몬),★,10 Jul 2025,"Superman unfolds less as a triumph than as a symptom, one whose failures reveal the conditions of its own emergence. Not merely cinematic ineptitude, it serves as an index of the industrial-ideological machinery that shapes blockbuster production.

Reboot cycles, serialization, and universe-building bureaucracies suppress singularity beneath the relentless flow of branded circulation.

James Gunn has done a good job at bringing back the hope and optimism in the Superman name. I was grinning at the nostalgic feeling of watching a Saturday morning cartoon. It embraces the wacky sci-fi and goofiness. Sometime a little hard on the corniness. But this is a type of film that the world desperately needs right now.

SiddhantAdlakha,★★★,9 Jul 2025,"There's a lot riding on James Gunn's Superman, both as a reboot of DC's movie universe and as the world's reintroduction to the Man of Steel. It's fitting, then, that its closest analog is Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Disney's ambitious 2015 relaunch of a galaxy far, far away. Like The Force Awakens, Superman similarly leaves plot threads dangling in mid-air, but papers over its flaws by moving at a million miles an hour and centering a charismatic cast.
