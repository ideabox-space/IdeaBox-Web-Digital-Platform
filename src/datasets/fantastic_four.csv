Comfortably the best that the Fantastic Four has ever been on screen, and somehow still a middling Marvel introductory episode.

I enjoyed the film overall! However, I felt it moved a bit quickly, which left the characters underdeveloped. Galactus had great potential as a villain, yet I didn't feel he was fully realized in the way he was marketed or written. I also wished the humor would have landed better for me. On the bright side, the intergalactic travel action scenes were thrilling and impressive. The aesthetics were stunning, and my girl Vanessa Kirby truly shined in her role.
Overall, good film.

TheMovieMob,★★★½,25 Jul 2025,"✅ 3.6 / 5 ✅ — The Fantastic Four: First Steps is a stylish, heartfelt reboot that skips the origin story and mostly sticks the landing.
The Fantastic Four: First Steps brings a fresh twist to the Marvel Universe with its retro alternate-universe vibe.

Visually, it’s the most stunning MCU film yet. The retro-futuristic ’60s aesthetic gives it a distinct tone, full of bold color and imaginative design, like a live-action Jetsons.

The classic-style visuals and musical score also contribute to the film's striking appeal. They are empathetic and formidable. However, Galactus's role as an intimidating villain is somewhat underexplored, leaving him largely a mere filler.

Darren Carver-Balsiger,★★★½,24 Jul 2025,"The Fantastic Four: First Steps is not a particularly amazing superhero film, but it is a standout compared to a lot of its contemporaries. Firstly it has a distinct aesthetic, at least in the costumes and production design, though the cinematography and filmmaking is rather bland otherwise. However it's not just that First Steps looks distinct, but that it builds a 60s utopianist vision. The world of the film is one of peace and benevolent leaders. It's a very wholesome… more",148 likes
